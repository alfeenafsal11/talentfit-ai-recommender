# TalentFit AI: Conversational SHL Assessment Recommender

An autonomous, conversational assistant designed to guide recruiters and hiring managers from vague hiring intents to grounded, actionable assessment shortlists.

> [!NOTE]
> **Private Portfolio Project**: This repository represents an independent engineering work demonstrating a robust, production-grade conversational recommendation system. It leverages the public product catalog and problem framework from SHL (a global leader in talent assessment solutions) as a reference dataset to build and validate a multi-agent deterministic orchestrator.

## Problem Summary
Finding the right assessment from a large catalog can be overwhelming. Users often lack the exact vocabulary or domain knowledge to search effectively. This system solves that problem by using natural dialogue to clarify requirements, refine choices, and recommend precise assessments. The system is additionally designed to surface ML fairness considerations relevant to high-stakes talent assessment contexts.

## Architecture
The system employs a **Deterministic Orchestration** pattern. Rather than relying on a single large LLM prompt to manage state, routing, and search—which often leads to hallucinations and brittle behavior—the architecture decomposes into specialized, deterministic agents:

- **Agent 1 (Retrieval):** A hybrid engine that uses BM25 (word overlap fallback) for exact keyword matches and dense embeddings for semantic search.
- **Agent 2 (Intent):** A conversation state tracker that parses history to extract structured slots (Role, Seniority, Skills).
- **Agent 3 (Workflow):** The orchestrator that routes user inputs to specific logic flows (Recommend, Clarify, Refine, Compare).
- **Agent 10 (Scope Guard):** A hard boundary that strictly refuses prompt injections, legal queries, or off-topic conversation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r shl_recommender/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` inside `shl_recommender/` and add your Groq/OpenAI API key.

## Run Instructions

Start the FastAPI service:
```bash
cd shl_recommender
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## API Usage

### `GET /health`
Returns a readiness status.

### `POST /chat`
Accepts a stateless conversation history array and returns an agent reply and recommendations if ready.
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I need a java developer assessment"}
  ]
}
```

## Evaluation
The system is evaluated against 10 benchmark conversational traces using `evaluate.py`.
It strictly measures:
- Schema Compliance
- 100% Catalog adherence (No Hallucinations)
- Mean Recall@10
- Behavior probe pass rates (Scope guarding, refinement handling, etc.)

To run the evaluation harness:
```bash
cd shl_recommender
python evaluate.py --conversations ../dataset/sample_conversations/GenAI_SampleConversations --catalog ../dataset/catalog.txt
```

## Design Decisions
- **Stateless Reconstruction:** Every `/chat` call includes the full history. The system reconstructs the `ConversationState` entirely from this history on every turn. This allows infinite horizontal scaling without sticky sessions or DB dependencies.
- **Catalog-Only Enforcement:** All URLs are injected directly from the deterministic retrieval step, never synthesized by the LLM. 
- **Graceful Degradation:** If the LLM rate-limits or fails, the system falls back to returning a formatted string of the top recommendations, preserving 100% schema compliance and functional UI utility.

## Limitations
- The underlying hybrid search relies on TF-IDF fallback when `rank-bm25` is unavailable, slightly lowering recall on heavily keyword-dependent queries.
- The system focuses exclusively on Individual Test Solutions (not Pre-packaged Solutions) in accordance with the target architectural scope.
- Recall@10 = 0.328 on public traces (BM25-only baseline: 0.213). Zero-recall traces 
  (C2, C7, C9, C10) are caused by catalog vocabulary gaps, not retrieval model failure — 
  the expected assessments exist but their descriptions lack query-aligned terminology.
- Seniority hard-filtering causes false negatives for assessments with empty 
  job_level_buckets. A soft-penalty approach would improve recall without sacrificing 
  precision significantly.
